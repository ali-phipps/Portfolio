# I can model anything

I can use the appropriate diagram to visualise my domain, and to save time when designing my programs and solution architecture. eg

* Class diagram
* Sequence diagram
* Component architecture

I use diagrams to help reach a common understanding when working in a team



I use OO principles to guide my modelling to make my code easy to understand and change

* [E](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-concepts-21bb035f7260/)ncapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism
* DRY and SRP
* SOLID
