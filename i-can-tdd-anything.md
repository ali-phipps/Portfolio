# I can TDD anything

I use strict TDD without thinking ahead about implementation. Working story at a time, I allow the code to evolve behaviour based on the tests I write.

#### TDD Process

* I use Red, Green, Refactor to move in small steps
* I refactor based on my [refactor process](i-can-refactor-anything.md)

#### Testing

I understand the difference between black box and white box testing

I understand the difference between testing state v testing behaviour

I can unit test a class, using mocks/doubles to isolate dependencies on a class 

I understand feature testing, bringing together classes to test expected behaviour
