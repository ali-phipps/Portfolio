## I can debug Anything

### My Debugging Process

#### 1 Tighten the loop:

* Read through the stack trace and look at  error line number and file
* Track back through the codebase to the source of the error
* Check input args first for the method, then work through the code to see if we can spot the issue

#### 2 Get Visibility:

* Read the error message and any hints from the test framework
* Print in the tests first to get visibility
* Run the Check tests and output file after every change
