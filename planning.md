# Planning

#### Planning Process

1. Consume the user requirements \(stories\) one at a time, validating my understanding of the design by verbally playing back to the user and team.
2. Look to identify objects and methods by spotting nouns and verbs.
3. Diagram my understanding of the domain using my [modelling process](i-can-model-anything.md)
4. Understand the class dependencies to choose an optimum delivery path
5. Start TDDing the first class, just enough to meet the first story
