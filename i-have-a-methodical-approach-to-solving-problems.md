# I have a methodical approach to solving problems

#### Problem Solving in Software Delivery

Problem solving in delivery is a critical skill to allow us to break down seemingly impossibly complex problems. All problems regardless of size and complexity need a systematic process to break them down.

By developing my own problem solving skills and process, I can methodically tackle any problem to solve it. By having a process to follow, I can avoid getting stuck in blind alleys, and hopefully arrive at a better solution overall.

#### Problem Solving Principles

* Break a large problem into smaller simplier problems allows us to reduce complexity
* Keep breaking down until you find a simple enough problem that is solvable 
* User stories and story mapping can help structure this process when tackling complexity in user requirements
