# Week 1 notes

* Workshop - Debug process

  * Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
  * Pair using the driver-navigator style
  * Follow an effective debugging process
  * Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

* Workshop - TDD

I can break a problem down into simple steps

I use strict TDD without thinking ahead about implementation

* Red, Green, Refactor
* See repetition - refactor!
* See a pattern - refactor!
* Look to refactor both the code and the tests

build an app that takes a normal number and converts to a roman numeral equivalent up to and including 10



&lt;rspec -- init&gt; to set up rspec in new project

only use gem bundle install when you have dependencies to pull in

let - allows removal of duplication call
