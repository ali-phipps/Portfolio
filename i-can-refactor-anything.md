# I can refactor anything

### My Refactoring Process

As part of the [TDD cycle ](i-can-tdd-anything.md)I aim to clean and reorganise my code to align to best practice, while not changing the behaviour.

I aim to do little and often \(following TDD pattern of Red, Green, Refactor\) to reduce risk of refactoring and to ensure code health.

I refactor both my code and my tests.

**I look for the following refactoring opportunities:**

* Repetition, eg DRY
* Patterns emerging in logic
* Do my classes and methods adhere to [OO modelling](i-can-model-anything.md) best practice?
